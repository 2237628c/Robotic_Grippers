# Summer work

* Designing a new Gripper for compsci Robots
* Adam Christie
* 2237628c
* Gerardo Camarasa

## Research completed
Dr Camarasa advised that I become familiar with a CAD software and suggested some AutoDesk softwares, so I installed AutoDesk fusion and worked through a couple of youtube tutorials until I was familiar with it.

Read up on how ROS works and read through some of the tutorials on the ROS website. Tried to get ROS working several times on different machines but I ended up using a virtual machine to be able to run it. I then worked through the beginner tutorials given on the website so I would have a base understanding of how it works and is set up.

## Ideas developed
I had a look at several grippers out there and got a general idea of the main types of gripper that are out there.

## Concerns or risks identified
Research did not raise many concerns except for how well the ROS will work on the virtual machine.
