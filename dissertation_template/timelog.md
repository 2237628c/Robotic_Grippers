## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 1
### 30th Sept 2019
* *4 hours* Prepared for meeting, collecting together summer work completed, questions I had about the project and timescales I should be trying to meet.

##1st Oct 2019
* *1 hour* Meeting with supervisor, going over questions.
* *3 hours* Researching different types of grippers, collecting together a group I believed to be suitable to go over with supervisor at the next meeting.

## 3rd Oct 2019
* *2 hour* Meeting with supervisor and post graduate. Here we selected the two grippers from the list I had, after discussion about their pro's and cons. Was also given a tour of the room I will be working in.
* *3 hours* Getting a virtual machine set up and going through more ROS tutorials.



## Week 2
###8th Oct 2019
* *1 hour* Getting a repository set up, committing dissertation template.
* *2 hours* Running designs on CAD software, assembling and committing to dissertation
* *1.5 hours* Researching on the components needed aside from plastic for 3D printing
* *1 hour* Collating components into list with quantities, prices and links for buying

###9th Oct 2019
* *2 hours* Reading documents to aid in writing dissertation
* *1 hour* Going through a few of the given previous dissertations

###10th Oct 2019
* *2 hours* Safety demonstration with Dr Camarasa so that I can use the robotics lab
* *1 hour* 3D Printing a simple cog to ensure that I know the procedure and can do it myself in the future.

###12th Oct 2019
* *1 hour* Planning rough outline for dissertation
* *2 hours* Research on motors and microprocessors


## Week 3 
###15th October
* *7 hours* 3D Printing, whilst also doing tutorials on ROS

###16th October
* *4 hours* 3D Printing, completed 3D printing first claw. 
* *2 hours* Began 3D printing 2nd Claw

###19th October
* *2 hours* researching another 3 fingered claw to print instead of original


## Week 4
###22nd October
* *1 hour* Research on other claw
* *3 hours* Assembling first claw, took longer due to not having screwdrivers that fit

###26th October
* *4 hours* Working through ROS tutorials, research on how to implement code onto Arduino and powering motor.
* *3 hours* Started writing the introduction of dissertation


## Week 5
###29th October
* *4 hours* Researching for background section of dissertation
* *4 hours* Began writing background, needs revision

###30th 
* *7 hours* 3D printing second claw, whilst doing dissertation work in between. 
* *1 hour* Creating parts list for second claw. 


##Week 6
###5th November 
* *7 hours* Finished 3D printing of second claw, assembling majority of it. 

###6th November
* *3 hours* Programmed arduino to control first claw, simple open close loop. 
* *2 hours* Trying to integrate ros subscriber/publisher with arduino 


##Week 7
###11th November
* *5 hours* Trying to find work around for running out of space on Ubuntu VM, not successful

###12th November
* *2 hours* Trying to boot from USB, successful but less storage than VM 
* *5 hours* Trying to increase storage, 32GB USB but only giving 4GB storage space when booting due to Fat32 formatting. 

###13th November 
* *5 hours* Trying to dual boot from PC by creating partition, unsuccessfully.
* *1 hour* Creating UML diagram for code. 
 
 
 ##Week 8
 ###19th November
 * *1 hour* Setting up ROS and arduino on Robotics room pc
 * *4 hours* working on code to open and close claw on key hit 
 
 ###20th November 
 * *3 hours* More writing and editing off introduction and background, some more research involved. 
 * *4 hours* Working on code for opening and closing motor, can now get claw to open and close using o/p keys. 
 
 
 ##Week 9 
 ###26th November
 * *4 hours* Researching into what kind of feedback we can get from the motor, to see if it can close automatically and know when to stop. Research showed ability to "hack" ways to get feedback on certain servo motors.  
 * *1 hour* Taking apart motor to view internals, see if I can get underneath the board to try and get feedback but would be very difficult and not worth it as it isn't necessary.
 
 ###27th November 
 * *3 hours* Research and writing for Background and Introduction, getting closer to final version.
 * *3 hours* Research into motor for gripper2, a lot more complex than the servos we've been using so far. 

###28th November
* *3 hours* proof reading and finalising first two sections, ready to be submitted for feedback. 


##Week 10 
###5th December
* *2 hours* Meeting with supervisor about slowing progress due to exams, got another claw that has the motor I will use on the second claw, as the one ordered is still in a backlog. 

------Finished For Christmas Exams---------

##Week 0 
###2nd January 
* *2 hours* research on dynamixel MX-64 to see how to interface with Arduino without complex circuitry
* *1 hour* Research on TTL and RS-485 data transmissions, must find out what the motor uses before designing circuit for it. 
* *2 hours* Planning of Requirements section of dissertation. 

###3rd January
* *2 hours* Finished planning and write up of Requirements section, tidying up of repository done as well
* *1 hour* Planning out Design section of dissertation.

###4th January 
* *2 hours* Fixing repository, adding to gitignore and planning out bash script for users to run
